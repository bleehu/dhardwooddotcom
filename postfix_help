if I need to re-config the postfix server, I should run
$sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix

Postfix (main.cf) is now set up with a default configuration.  If you need to 
make changes, edit /etc/postfix/main.cf (and others) as needed.  To view 
Postfix configuration values, see postconf(1).

After modifying main.cf, be sure to run 'service postfix reload'.

to follow email hits, use tail -f /var/log/mail.log
